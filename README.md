There are 4 java files and one text file
Below is the brief for the prject requirements
Didn't manage to fulfil all the requested criteria, hope to do better in the future projects!

HAPPY CODING!

Operating Systems Project
Value – 20%
Your project is to write a Multi-threaded TCP Server Application which allows multiple users to create
a new bank account and perform various banking operations, including transferring funds to another
account.
1. Register with the system (Note PPS Number and Email must be unique)
• Name
• PPS Number
• Email
• Password
• Address
• Initial Balance
2. Log-in to the online banking system from the client application to the server application.
3. Lodge money to the user account.
4. Retrieve all registered users listing.
5. Transfer money to another account when providing the following recipient details:
• Email Address
• PPS Number
6. View all transaction on your bank account.
7. Update your password.
Server Application Rules
1. The server application should not provide of options 3-7 to a client application that has not
completed the authentication.
2. The server should hold a list of valid users of the service and a list of all the transactions
previously recorded with the systems.
3. All of client applications should be able to see all the users added by all the client applications.
Project Submission
Each student should submit the code developed to support both the server and client sides of the
application (Note: The code must be written in Java). In addition to the code each student should
submit a document explaining the various design decisions that were made during the project and
how their code works. Finally, a screencast should be included in the submission demonstrating the
complete functionality of the solution.
Submission Deadline
Project Submissions to be submitted via the online VLE by 11.59pm on the 30th of December 2023.
Points to Note
• Comments expected.
• Good programming practice is expected.
• Ensure that any files that are needed to run the program are included in your submission.
• Your code must run. A substantial deduction of marks will occur for code that is not running
correctly.
• Plagiarism is not acceptable.
• You may be asked to present your code/application.
